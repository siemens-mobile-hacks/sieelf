If you're reading this nonsense, then for some reason you needed source JKeyEmul (some crap ...) 

So, how to work with the utility JKeyFinder? 


(Method # 1 (Zamorochenny)) 

1) Run. 
2) Long press the '*' - the activation. 
3) Press the key that will subsequently be further injected code (for example, the right software). 
4) Now enter the code in the format of the keys DEC: 

 a) Click on one of the digits (0-9). 
 b) Once again, click on one of the digits (0-9). 

We now have a 2-digit number. 
(For example, first enter '0 ', then enter '7', '07 turned out ') / / 1 
(For example, first enter '7 ', then enter '1', '71 turned out ') / / 2 

5) Long press the '#' - Save the results with the message, 
which shows the real key code and key code, which it will be emulated: 
/ / / 
Real. the book.: 04 / / This means that the press the right soft, and she will give 07, ie in Java (for Sony Ericsson) will act 
Emulsion. the book.: 07 / / for example, opened the menu - an intuitive guess that this is the right software Sony Ericsson, and may make mistakes! 

Well if you believe that then enter in the config JKeyEmul -> Alt. Claudia -> right soft: 07 
Now in Java-application for JKeyEmul (c Emulations included ALT keyboard) into a demon and when you press the right soft treats Java, 
how the right software Sony Ericsson vyskochet, such as menus. 
/ / / 
If the pressed key code of the item (3) coincides with the entered key code, 
An error occurs and throws in paragraph (3). 

6) Another Long press the '*' dumping all, go to paragraph (2), or long press the '#' transition to paragraph (4). 


(Method # 2 (the simplest)) 
1) Run. 
2) Long press the '#' - Activation. 
3) Shortly press the '6 '- plus a key code (starting from 0 to 99) 
   Shortly press the '4 '- minus key code -1 
   Shortly press the '5 '- emulation keys with the received code. 
   Shortly press the '0 '- Displays the current key code. 
4) Shortly press the '#' - reset, go to paragraph (2). 

PS: In short, this is nonsense all!
