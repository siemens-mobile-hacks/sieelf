JKeyEmul 0.4

Elf to emulate the soft keys and joystick / cross from the other phone in Java-applications, if necessary.
Capturing keys (keyhuk), and therefore only works when emulating Java-midlet "upstairs."
Done to avoid various funny situations.

There is a keyboard emulation Sony Ericsson, Motorola.
And also there is a regime as "Alt. Clav." You are entering the key codes from an unknown elf phone
in the field of the corresponding joystick buttons / crosses and soft keys. If you entered "0", the key is not to be emulated,
ie keyhuk with buttons removed, the same thing will happen if the key code of the match with the entered code
ie the entry in the "right software" code "04" will not work.

Before setting up the config, make sure you have the latest CFGEdit, say because
I gave "Unsupported" (Because of the KeyCode), and seems to be recently updated.

Cancel key can match any key activation of emulation, but it still does not recommend
unnecessarily polling algorithm keys a little bluntly.

Nokia is missing key emulation, unnecessarily I do not have the key codes,
cmotrel from many sources, they coincide with the SE (not saying)
downloaded a game from Nokia, Siemens, and to work without emulation.

Finally, I have experience writing elf is very small, it is the second elf, so I do not judge strictly,
Emulation works without any patches and I can not guarantee that everything will be running a test on SGold, and several games.
