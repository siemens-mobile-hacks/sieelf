LaunchElf 1.99 
! ElfPack, FreeRam 

is and the patch and elf 
patch completely replaces the standard table of shortcuts (their functions, id lengpaka) and table fast start (the list of shortcuts for possible appointment to the keys on the main screen) 
Elf needs for quick editing of the table / add elves 

Now in the file 0: \ \ Zbin \ \ etc \ \ shortcuts.dat stored binary list of shortcuts (such at cx75_13 he is at 0xA04B09D4) 
0: \ \ Zbin \ \ etc \ \ fr_shortcuts.dat - Table Quick Launch (list of shortcuts) (in cx75_13 located at 0xA04A6448) 
0: \ \ Zbin \ \ etc \ \ shortcut_names.dat - full and abbreviated names of the shortcuts and ways of the elves 

with a patch, you can: 
add a new shortcut with a unique name (for example call a function) 
add Elf / file for quick start 
change the existing shortcut 

to add elf manually: add shortcut to shortcuts.dat (shortcut structure described in swilib.h) 
lgp id number of full and short name is replaced by 0x7FFE 
! Names of shortcuts in this list should be sorted alphabetically, or does not work 
I will not forget the past 
in fr_shortcuts add the name of the shortcut (15simv. + 0x00) 
in shortcut_names.dat write the full name of elf (15simv. + 0x00), a short title (15simv. + 0x00), the path to the elf (127simv, 0x00) 


to add with an elf: 
in elf: adding an elf - a green button, delete (elf, shortcuts) - grating in the rest of the familiar:)
