(!) Conflict with all the patches on the memory 
   Cancel the previous version of the patch

Description 
Here on the basis of all knowledge and patches of RAM on X65, decided to make a single "mega" patch. 
When you run the phone is counting the RAM, ie divided into 
NonPermMemory, PermMemory, JavaHeap, the rest of us are not interested. 
So, the patch loads configuration partition and, if necessary, stop 
downloading a browser or Java-machine (or both). 
Settings (1 byte) are in the 5304 block EEFULL, so to change them 
require a special elf-configurator. 
Options for work with PS / failami during the patch does not work, 
therefore attributable to use EEPROM. 

By the way, this patch does, and F-uw patch CutHeap. 

Ect 8 fixed regimes, as opportunity 
free, and most importantly, change the values of mismanagement 
memory can lead to poor results, 
and in particular pikoffu startup or non-inclusion of all, that's it! 

  1 - Normal 
  2 - Killed browser 
  3 - Increase NonPermMmem 
  4 - Murdered browser + Increase NonPermMmem (NonPermSize: 4 Mb) 
  5 - Optimal NonPerm / JavaHeap # 1 (NonPermSize: 3.5 Mb, JavaHeap: 2 Mb) 
  6 - Optimal NonPerm / JavaHeap # 2 (NonPermSize: 2.5 Mb, JavaHeap: 3 Mb) 
  7 - Maximum NonPermMem (NonPermSize: 5,64 Mb) (Java does not work!) 
  8 - Maximum JavaHeap (NonPermSize: 1 Mb, JavaHeap: 4.2 Mb) 

Startup option set special elf-configurator 
You can launch the browser without rebooting. 
* Lists the full dimensions of memory (but not free!)
